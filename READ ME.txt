GAMOSCE V11.0
(Brucella Genus, Abortus, Melitensis, Ovis, Suis, Canis genome-based identification with E-probe)

This version is for Windows users, one-click identification of Brucella genus and 5 significant Brucella species. Users do not need to write code.

GAMOSCE is a tool based python that employs a combination of * in silico * the 126 specific tags of Brucella to rapidly identify *Brucella genus and 5 significant Brucella species * isolates using nucleotide sequencing data.

Decompress agile.zip, Open agile_start Shortcut, click Select File to open the sequencing file or click Select Folder to load sequence of whole folder.The common nucleic acid sequences can be loaded

Note that office files in .doc, .xls, .ppt and other formats cannot be loaded.

After entering the sequencing results, clicking open means start identification.
1. The software uses the specific e-probe for accurate identification of Brucella genus, include 11 species: Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella suis, Brucella ovis, Brucella neotomae, Brucella canis, Brucella ceti, Brucella pinnipedialis, Brucella microti, Brucella inopinata, Brucella vulpis. 
2. Then, the software distinguishes several kinds of Brucella species that are clearly threatening human health from Brucella genus, including Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis, Brucella canis and Brucella ovis. 
3. The Tag126 are all Brucella-specific probes. As long as one probe is detected in the target sequence, the detection result is positive.
